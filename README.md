Timed Typer
---

This game is a very minimal typing tutor style game where you type what's on screen within a given amount of time. If you take too long or type it wrong, you lose. You get a score at the end.

## Future Implementations

* Making the high score feature work.
* Game progressively gets faster as you progress.
* Difficulty levels that limit words of a certain size.
